    <div id="about" class="container">
        <section id="who">
            <h1>Who am I?</h1>
            <p>Hi, I'm Leonardo! I'm currently pursuing an apprenticeship as a software engineer at the largest telecommunications company in Switzerland. This journey allows me to combine my passion for technology with hands-on experience in real-world projects. When I’m not at work or school, you’ll most likely find me on the football field. Football has always been a big part of my life, which is why I prefer summer over winter—there’s nothing better than playing in the sun.</p>
            <p>Languages have also played an important role in my life. I’m fluent in German, Italian, and English, which helps me connect with people from different backgrounds. I also studied French for a few years in school, and while I wouldn’t call myself fluent, I can understand quite a bit.</p>
            <p>Beyond coding and sports, I'm always eager to explore new technologies, improve my skills, and take on exciting challenges. Whether it’s developing new projects, experimenting with IoT devices, or diving into cybersecurity concepts, I love pushing myself to learn and grow.</p>

        <section id="why">
            <h1>Why Software Engineering?</h1>
            <p>My interest in technology began when I was around 9 years old. I got my first laptop, a Fujitsu, after my father received a new one from work. I was beyond excited and spent hours exploring how it worked—downloading files, creating folders, and customizing settings. These simple tasks felt like a whole new world to me.</p>
            <p>One day, while searching something on Google, I discovered the Inspect Element tool. Seeing the website’s code made me feel like a hacker—I could change things on the page! My excitement quickly faded when I refreshed the site, but that moment sparked my curiosity and passion for technology.</p>
            <p>As I grew older, I explored various career paths, but software engineering stood out. The ability to build solutions, solve challenges, and bring ideas to life through code made it clear this was my future. Today, I continue to develop my skills and deepen my passion for programming, constantly learning and evolving in this ever-changing field.</p>
